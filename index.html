            <p>
              Matt is a diehard Texan, that doesn't own a cowboy hat and
              Katrina is a Colorado girl who doesn't like snow, but between his
              affinity for technology and her love of crafts they have no
              problem building their life together. Thanks to their military
              service, they initially met while in Qatar, where they managed to
              see all the sites in Doha.  Their first date was Sushi which
              remains a main stay for date nights.  This would be the beginning
              of a long road ahead.

            <h3>Back to America</h3>
            <p>
              After they redeployed they spent a full year of long distance
              dating with lots of flights from South Carolina to Texas and
              vice versa, being in the air would soon become a norm to Matt as
              he starts taking on bigger roles and responsibilities with work.
              The 1,000 miles that seperated them would prove to be difficult
              but they enjoyed the opportunity to travel to new places and
              new things. They were able to finally be in the same state when
              Katrina got stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA.  Matt had
              the option to stay with his company and work remotly from the
              comfort of his home.

            <h3>The Pacific Northwest</h3>
            <p>
              Thanks to a mutual love of outdoor activities, delicious sea food,
              and craft beer the two have loved Washington and everything the
              Pacific Northwest has to offer.  On Valentine's Day of 2016,
              Matt gave Katrina a super shiny ring, he proposed on the water in
              Seattle and they celebrated with a trip to the original Starbucks
              and a fancy dinner, because nothing is better than new jewelry,
              good coffee and tasty food.  When Katrina leaves the Army in
              December 2016, they will start on the next adventure leading up to
              tying the knot in July 2017.
